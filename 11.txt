Arrays and loops:
Arrays : an array is another type of value that we use in javascript 
Array represents a list fo other values 
indexing of the array is same as all the other languages : it starts from zero upto n-1.

Changing a value of the array.
  array[index]= value of choice.(provided that the array is defined).

syntax rule for arrays:
  start with a [ and end with a ].
  seperate each value with a comma.
  you can access or change the value by using the index.

Arrays support any kind of valye string , number, boolean, objects or arrays  or a combination of all .
Arrays are actually objects but some special type of objects .
to check if something is actually an array you can actually use a fucntion;
Array.isArray(name of the array or array);

you can get the length of the array by using the .length fucntion.

some methods of the array:
1. push(); :this adds a number in the array towards the end of the array
2. splice();: this removes the number from the array , it accepts 2 value one is : index and the other one is the number of the values to remove.

LOOPS:
the loops help us run the code over and over .
ther are two types of loop:
while and for

ACCUMULATOR PATTERN:
1. create a variable to store the result.
2. loop through the array and update the result.
