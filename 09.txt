DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL:
  1. this is another built in object called as document object.
  2. Document object represents the web page / models the webpage,
    when we change the property of the document object then we also change the webpage
  3.DOM combines javascript and html togethor. 
  4. we can use document.body to access the body emelent inside the javascript.
  5.when inside javascript the body element becomes an aboject of javascript
  6.innerHTML is a property of body as now body has become an object so we can use properties on it .
  7.The innerHTML property controls the html inside the body.
  8.methods of the document object:
    document.querySelector();:  this helps in selecting a particular element of html and put it inside the javascript.
  9.Every html element has a property called as innerHTML which lets us control the html inside the element.
  
  DOCUMENT.querySelector():
    EXAMPLE:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
     <head>
     <title></title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <button class="js-button1">button1</button>
      <script>
        document.querySelector('.js-button1') // this will select the button with the class selector.
      </script>
     </body>
    </html>
    10. since html element in javascript is an object and the object is a variable so we can assign the html element in a variable.
    EXAMPLE: 
      const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.js-button1');
      the variable buttonElement will now contain the html for the 
      .js-button.
