DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: (just the document object)
  1. this is another built in object called as document object.

  2. Document object represents the web page / models the webpage,
    when we change the property of the document object then we also change the webpage

  3.DOM combines javascript and html togethor. we can have html elements in the javascript, DOM gives the control of the  website to javascript

  4. we can use document.body to access the body emelent inside the javascript.

  5.when inside javascript the body element becomes an aboject of javascript

  6.innerHTML is a property of body as now body has become an object so we can use properties on it .

  7.The innerHTML property controls the html inside the body.

  8.methods of the document object:
    document.querySelector();:  this helps in selecting a particular element of html and put it inside the javascript.

  9.Every html element has a property called as innerHTML which lets us control the html inside the element.
  
  DOCUMENT.querySelector():
    EXAMPLE:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
     <head>
     <title></title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <button class="js-button1">button1</button>
      <script>
        document.querySelector('.js-button1') // this will select the button with the class selector.
      </script>
     </body>
    </html>

10. since html element in javascript is an object and the object is a variable so we can assign the html element in a variable.
    EXAMPLE: 
      const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.js-button1');
      the variable buttonElement will now contain the html for the 
      .js-button.

11. innerHTML vs innerText 

  innerHTML control of  all the HTML which are under the body tag.
  the innerHTML gets us the text inside a button with the spaces but the innerText gets us the text inside an element without any spaces.

12. click and keydown are called as events .

13. onclick and on keydown are called as event-listeners.

14.list of a few event listeners are:
    onclick     = click
    onkeydown   =keypress
    onscroll    =scrolling
    onmouseenter =hovering over
    onmouseleave =stop hovering over
15. GETTING A VALUE FROM THE INPUT: use the .value property to get the value of the input element as:
  

16. TYPE COERCION or automatic type conversion.
     console.log('25'-5); // the string 25 will automatically be converted to a number and hence an example of type coercion or automatic type conversion.
     console.log above will return 20

17. but the addition of the same string happens differently:
    console.log('25' + 5);
    console.log here will return 255 as the typer conversion goes to string this time.

18.Window : is a built in object that represents the webpage this is same as writing console.log() but isntead it is written as windows.console.log()
    Every thing inside an webpage comes under the window object hence the console ,Document,alert and everything on a browser comes under the windows object.
    But we never write window.document or windows.alert as the java script completes it for us.

19. always do math using number and not string .
