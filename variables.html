          1. cant use sepcial words example let let =3
          2. cant start with a number
          3. cant use special characters except $ and _
          4. semicolon means that it is the end of an instruction
          5. java script has a feature called semicolon insertion where it automatically  adds semicolon at the end of the sentences.
